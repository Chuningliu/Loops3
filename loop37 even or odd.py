# Write a  python program code for loops in which if we enter a odd number as User
# input it should print that specific number half times of that number and if user 
# input is even then it should print that number as many times as the number.


# n=int(input("enter the number:-"))
# i=1
# while i<=n:
#     if n%2==0:
#         print(n,"even")
#     else:
#         a=n//2
#         b=0
#         while b<a:
#             print(n,"odd")
#             b=b+1
